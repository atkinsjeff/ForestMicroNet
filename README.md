## ForestMicroNet:  A Forest Microclimate Monitoring Network

### Why monitor forest microclimates?
Understanding the magnitude and spatial variability of 
current and future climate in southeastern US forests is key to maintaining forest health, productivity, and
habitat provision. However, adequate characterization of climate variability at management relevant
spatial scales (10s to 100s of square meters) is hindered by an overreliance on gridded climate data (with
resolutions of 10s of hectares to 10s of square kilometers) which are informed by networks of free-air
weather stations, typically located in open fields, far from forests. Such positioning may negate any
influence of local effects created by forests or topography including localized microclimates that are
decoupled from broader climatic patterns. Remotely sensed data often lack the necessary spatiotemporal
resolution to resolve this problem, resulting in biases or limitations to the use of many climate data
products to inform forest-relevant research and management. A baseline understanding of local effects—
specifically how microclimates vary in space and time—is necessary to climate mitigation efforts. 

To address this need, we propose the creation of a forest microclimate monitoring network using a uniform,
fractal sampling design with standardized measurements of microclimatological variables across multiple
USFS Experimental Forests and cooperating forests within the Southern Research Station region.
